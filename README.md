The HEAL Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python provides classes and functions for handling HEAL specific tasks.

## QDR downloads

The `qdr_downloads` module include a retriever function for downloading files from Syracuse QDR.

This is intended to be called by Gen3SDK [external download functions](https://github.com/uc-cdis/gen3sdk-python/blob/master/gen3/tools/download/external_file_download.py). It is also possible to write a wrapper script for the QDR download functions.

## Harvard downloads

The `harvard_downloads` module include a retriever function for downloading files from Harvard Dataverse.

This is intended to be called by Gen3SDK [external download functions](https://github.com/uc-cdis/gen3sdk-python/blob/master/gen3/tools/download/external_file_download.py). It is also possible to write a wrapper script for the Dataverse download functions.

## Notebooks

In the notebooks directory there are jupyter notebooks that may be used to download files from a corresponding platform that requires an external file retriever. For instance the external_data_download.ipynb notebook may be used to download files from data repositories like Syracuse QDR and/or Harvard Dataverse.

These notebooks perform optimally within a HEAL Gen3 Workspace and the notebooks will be automatically installed to a user's workspace when the workspace is initiated. However, you may also use these notebooks on your local machine.

## VLMD extraction and validation


The [VLMD documentation](heal/vlmd/README.md) describes how to use the SDK for extracting and validating VLMD dictionaries.

## CLI

The SDK exposes a Command Line Interface (CLI) for some functions.

The CLI can be invoked as follows

`heal [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]`

For a list of commands and options run

`heal --help`

For example, the following can validate a VLMD file in csv format:

`heal vlmd validate --input_file "vlmd_for_validation.csv"`

The [VLMD documentation](heal/vlmd/README.md) provides information on
using the VLMD functions, such as `extract` and `validate`.


## Installing the SDK

The `heal-platform-sdk` is available on PyPI. Local installs can be handled with `pip`:

```bash
pip install heal-sdk
```

or by poetry, say in a `pyproject.toml` file:

```
heal-sdk = ">=1.0.0"
```

### Pip install for specific branches

If a particular branch is desired any pip installs should directly
reference the git repo and branch. For example, the following installs
the branch `my-branch` of the SDK:

```bash
pip install -e git+https://github.com/uc-cdis/heal-platform-sdk.git@my-branch#egg=heal
```

### Run tests

For local development of the SDK the unit tests are run with:

```bash
poetry run pytest -vv tests
```
